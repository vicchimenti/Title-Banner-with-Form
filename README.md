# Title Banner with Embedded Form

Title banners are the most common banner on landing and home pages. They are large and attractive, but often confuse users as they take up prime real-estate above the fold. This project aims to meet our clients need by embedding a responsive form allowing a user to submit RFI fields immediately when they land on the page.

## T4 Form Fields
* Name
    * plaintext
* Preamble
    * html
* T4 Tag
    * plaintext
* Zone Option
    * radio buttons


### Challenges
The banner is actually a background, so when placing the active form on the banner it becomes part of the background which mutes the active elements
